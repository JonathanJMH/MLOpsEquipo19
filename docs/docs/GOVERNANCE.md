# Project Machine Learning Governance

This document describes the governance policies and practices implemented in this MLOps project. These policies aim to ensure transparency, traceability, security, and effectiveness in the development, deployment, and monitoring of Machine Learning models.

## 1. Version Control

### Code
- All source code for the project is managed using Git.
- Any significant change must be reviewed and approved through pull requests before merging into the main branch.
- Frequent and descriptive commits are required to facilitate traceability.

### Data and Models
- Data and models are managed using DVC, enabling detailed version control.
- Every change to data or models must include a description in the commit explaining the reason for the update and its implications.
- MLflow is used to log model versions and experiment results.

## 2. Documentation
- `README.md` should contain a general description of the project, its objectives, and a basic usage guide.
- `mlruns/` should include detailed notes and results of the experiments performed.
- Governance Policies (this file) should be updated with any changes in governance practices.
- Any updates to models, data, or code should be thoroughly documented in a changelog or release notes file.

## 3. Security and Privacy
- **Controlled Access**: Only team members with the appropriate permissions can make changes to the repository. Permissions are managed through GitHub teams.
- **Data Privacy**: Sensitive personal data must be anonymized before being used in the models.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR and other relevant data handling laws.

## 4. Model Testing and Validation

### Code Testing
- Unit tests are located in the `tests/` folder and cover the main modules.
- Before merging a pull request, tests must be executed to ensure that the change does not break functionality.

### Model Testing
- Each new model must pass validation tests that include metrics for accuracy, sensitivity, and stability.
- Model performance is monitored in production to ensure they meet quality standards.

## 5. Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Model Monitoring**: Model performance is monitored in production to detect potential performance issues and data drift.
- **Alerts**: If a model falls below a specific performance threshold, an alert will be sent to the team to evaluate the need for retraining.
- **Model Update**: Models are updated periodically or when significant changes in performance are detected.

## 6. Auditing and Compliance
- **Activity Logs**: All model and data changes are logged in MLflow and DVC to ensure full auditability.
- **Periodic Review**: Each quarter, a review of the pipeline and model performance in production is conducted to assess its effectiveness and compliance with policies.

## 7. Automation and CI/CD
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions is used to automate tests, training, and model deployment on each commit.
- **Automated Validation**: Before deploying, model and data versions must pass automated validation to ensure stability and quality.
