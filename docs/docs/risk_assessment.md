# Risk Assessment

## Identified Risks

1. **Data Quality Risks**:
   - Incomplete or inaccurate data can lead to erroneous predictions.

2. **Model Performance Risks**:
   - The model may not generalize well to new, unseen data, leading to poor performance.

3. **Compliance Risks**:
   - Failure to comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

- Implement data validation checks before training.
- Regularly monitor model performance in production.
- Stay updated with compliance regulations and ensure all data practices align with them.

## Contingency Plans

- **Data Quality Issues**:
  - If data issues are detected, revert to the last valid dataset and re-evaluate the data pipeline for errors.

- **Model Performance Drops**:
  - If performance drops below a predefined threshold, initiate retraining with the latest data and review model parameters.

- **Compliance Breaches**:
  - Immediately notify the team, conduct a review of data practices, and implement corrective actions as needed.
